# 🧪 Go Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, focused projects written in Go, designed to help solidify core concepts and improve practical skills through repetition and experimentation. Each folder is an isolated CLI-based application that showcases a particular aspect of the language.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each subfolder contains a standalone `main.go` file with zero dependencies beyond the Go standard library. Projects are easy to run, read, and modify.
